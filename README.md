Clone any files you want. Totally free. 

**To run python files in Windows:** download the installer here: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/, then run python files by opening command prompt and typing:
```
python (filename)
```
**To run on Linux or MacOS:** install [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) then run:
```
brew install python3
```
You should be able to run files simply by typing:
```
python (filename)
```
(Python is normally already installed on Linux, check by typing:<code> python --version</code>)

If the program comes with a .bat file, after you install python simply double click the .bat file to run it in Command Prompt if you are on Windows.

Be sure to check out the Wiki for more information about each file.

**Enjoy**
